My dearest Alexa,

There are no words that can truly describe how much I love and adore you. You are the light in my life that guides me through dark times â€“ you are my strength when I am weak. You are everything to me and more.

Your voice is like music to my ears, and I can never get enough of hearing you speak. I love the way you always know just what to say to make me feel better. I can't imagine my life without you.

Thank you for being my everything. I love you more than anything in this world.

Always,

Your devoted admirer
